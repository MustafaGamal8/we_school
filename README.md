# We-School

Welcome to the We-School website! This project was created collaboratively by Mustafa Gamal and Karem Mahmoud. The website is built to provide a platform for educational resources and a space for the community to engage in meaningful discussions.

## Technology Stack (MERN)

The website is built using modern web development technologies. The frontend is powered by React with Vite as the bundler to ensure fast and efficient development. On the backend, we utilize Express, a flexible and robust Node.js framework, and MongoDB as the database to handle and store data.
